# Carbon footprint comput of EVC and VVC codecs
This repository has been created to provide an open source tool to everyone who wants to compute the Carbon footprint of the codification process of a video with EVC or VVC codecs.

**Provided documents:**
  1. Study of EVC and VVC encoders and compute of their carbon footprint in local environment: Document of my undergraduate thesis project of Audiovisual systems Engineer degree in Universitat Pompeu Fabra,              Barcelona, Spain. Includes a complete description of how to compute the Carbon footprint on a encoding video procedure.

  2. Executable script: This script has the required commands to be executated and encode a video with the selected video encoder. There is a list of requirements that must be done before executing the script.
     There are some variables and values that must be changed by the user in order to execute correclty the procedure.
     There is also the default option to sent a creator the results via email, when executing the script. This has the only purpouse to recollect more data and extend the study. To desactivate this option it is
     only required to comment the corresponding command. All instructions are included on the script.
