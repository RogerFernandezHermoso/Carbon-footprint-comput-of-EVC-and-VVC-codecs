# Carbon footprint comput of EVC and VVC codecs
This repository has been created to provide an open source tool to everyone who wants to compute the Carbon footprint of the codification process of a video with EVC or VVC codecs. It is implemented for Linux operating system.

**Provided material:**
  1. Study of EVC and VVC encoders and compute of their carbon footprint in local environment: Document of my undergraduate thesis project of Audiovisual systems Engineer degree in Universitat Pompeu Fabra,              Barcelona, Spain. Includes a complete description of how to compute the Carbon footprint on a encoding video procedure.

  2. Executable script: This script has the required commands to be executated and encode a video with 4k resolution and EVC encoder. The lines to encode with VVC encoder are commented. The user must change the values as it is described on the 1. document.
