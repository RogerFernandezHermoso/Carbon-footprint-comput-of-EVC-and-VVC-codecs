# Carbon footprint compute of EVC and VVC codecs
This repository has been created to provide an open-source tool to everyone who wants to compute the Carbon footprint of the codification process of a video with EVC or VVC codecs. It is implemented for Linux operating system.

**Provided material:**
  1. Study of EVC and VVC encoders and compute their carbon footprint in local environment: Document of my undergraduate thesis project for Audiovisual Systems Engineer degree in Universitat Pompeu Fabra,              Barcelona, Spain. Includes a complete description of how to compute the Carbon footprint on an encoding video procedure.

  2. Executable script: This script has the required commands to be executed  and encode a video with 4k resolution and EVC encoder. The lines to encode with VVC encoder are commented. The user must change the values as it is described in the 1. document.
