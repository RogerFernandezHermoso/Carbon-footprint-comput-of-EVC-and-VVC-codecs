# Carbon footprint compute of EVC and VVC codecs
This repository has been created to provide an open-source tool to everyone who wants to compute the Carbon footprint of the codification process of a video with EVC or VVC codecs. It is implemented for Linux operating system.

**Provided material:**
  1. Study of EVC and VVC encoders and compute their carbon footprint in local environment: Document of my undergraduate thesis project for Audiovisual Systems Engineer degree in Universitat Pompeu Fabra,              Barcelona, Spain. Includes a complete description of how to compute the Carbon footprint on an encoding video procedure.

  2. List of executable scripts: Scripts that have the required commands to be executed and encode with the corresponding resolution and video encoder set in their name. The instructions are provided in the document 1.
     
          - EVC: HD, 4k, 8k and all videos continuously.
          - VVC: HD, 4k, 8k and all videos continuously.
